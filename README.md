Alx 0x16-simple shell project

Building a simple shell using C programming language that actually works. A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system by entering commands. Our simple shell will be capable of executing basic commands and handling some built in functionalities.

Steps To Take...
1. Setting Up A Project i.e creating a new directory for your shell project, thereby keeping it organized.
2. Creating The Main Source Page: Using preferred text editor (e.g., vi, emacs, vim...)
3. Parsing and Executing Commands: Inside the while loop in main(), you can parse and execute the entered commands. Use the fork(), execvp(), and wait() system calls for this purpose.
4. Adding Built-in Functionalities e.g, cd (change directory)
5. Compiling your simple shell project using a C compiler (e.g, gcc shell.c -o shell)
6. Run your simple shell project (e.g, ./shell)
7. Using Your Simple Shell
You can now enter commands like you would in a regular terminal. Your simple shell will execute basic commands and handle built-in functionalities.

Conclusion
At this point, you've successfully created a simple shell that can execute basic commands and can handle built-in functionalites.
